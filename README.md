## ✨ Key Features

### 🌓 Dual-Phase Visibility
* **Stealth Mode (Dark)**: A deep-space aesthetic designed to reduce eye strain during late-night deployments.
* **Command Mode (Light)**: A high-clarity, daylight-optimized interface featuring crisp glassmorphism.
* **Persistent Phase**: Utilizes localStorage and CSS variables to ensure your visual preference remains locked across all sessions.

### 💧 Liquid Analytics
* **Weekly Fuel Levels:** A custom-built bar graph featuring "Liquid Grow" animations that trigger on every dashboard update.
* **Elastic Physics:** Bars use custom `cubic-bezier` transitions to bounce and settle like liquid being poured into a vessel.
* **Temporal Sync:** Automatically maps tasks to the correct day of the week (Sun-Sat) using local timezone normalization to prevent "date-shifting" bugs.

### ☁️ Real-Time Cloud Sync
* Instant synchronization between desktop and mobile devices.
* Powered by Firebase Realtime Database using the **Asia-Southeast** regional cluster for ultra-low latency.

### 🔒 Secure Access
* Private user authentication system via personal "Callsigns."
* **Data Isolation:** Your missions are strictly mapped to your UID; other operatives cannot see your dashboard.

### 📥 Archive Vault
* Move completed missions to a dedicated **Archive Vault** to keep your main workspace clean.
* Keeps a permanent record of past accomplishments for performance review.

### 🏷️ Smart Categorization
* **Work**, **Home**, **Personal**, and **Urgent** tags.
* Automatic color-coding for instant visual prioritization of your fleet's objectives.

## 📐 The Logic Engine

The application processes data using two core mathematical models:

1. **Fleet Completion Rate:**
   Calculated in real-time to update the circular "Mission Status" meter:
   $$P = \left( \frac{n_{done}}{n_{total}} \right) \times 100$$

2. **Temporal Mapping (Chart Logic):**
   To ensure tasks appear on the correct day regardless of UTC offsets, we use a local midnight anchor:
   $$\text{offset} = \lfloor \frac{t_{\text{target}} - t_{\text{sunday\_midnight}}}{86,400,000} \rfloor$$

## 🛡️ Firebase Security Rules

To keep your data private, apply these rules in your **Firebase Console > Realtime Database > Rules**:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "usernames": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
```
